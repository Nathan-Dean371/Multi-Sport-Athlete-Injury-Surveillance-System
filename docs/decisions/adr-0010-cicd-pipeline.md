# ADR-0010: CI/CD Pipeline and Automated Deployment

**Status:** Implemented

**Date:** February 19, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026 (Docker/ECR implementation completed)

**Deciders:** Nathan Dean

---

## Context

With cloud deployment planned (ADR-0009), a decision is needed on how code changes move from local development to the live EC2 environment. The system is developed across multiple machines (desktop and laptop), making a consistent, automated deployment process essential.

The key requirements are:
- Code changes should be reflected in the cloud environment without manual intervention
- The live environment should never be left in a broken state after a deployment
- Both databases (PostgreSQL on RDS, Neo4j on Aura) should be verified as reachable after every deployment
- The local development workflow should remain unchanged — develop locally against Docker, push to GitHub, automation handles the rest
- The test suite from ADR-0008 should be a mandatory gate before any deployment proceeds

**Key Question:** How do we automate building, testing, and deploying the NestJS backend to EC2 in a reliable, verifiable way?

---

## Decision

**Implement a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that runs tests, builds a Docker image, pushes to AWS ECR, deploys to EC2, and verifies the deployment via an automated health check.**

### Container-Based Deployment

The backend is containerized using Docker with a multi-stage build:
- **Builder stage**: Compiles TypeScript with all dependencies
- **Production stage**: Minimal Alpine Linux image with only production dependencies and compiled code
- **Result**: ~150MB production image (vs ~500MB with dev dependencies)
- **Security**: Non-root user, health checks built-in

Docker images are stored in **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, enabling:
- Version-tagged deployments
- Rollback capability
- Consistent environments (dev → test → production)
- Integration with AWS IAM for secure access

### Local Development Workflow (Unchanged)

       ↓
Stage 1: Unit Tests
  └── Run 81 unit tests (Jest)
       ↓
Stage 2: E2E Tests (service containers)
  ├── PostgreSQL Docker container
  ├── Neo4j Docker container
  ├── Run E2E test suite
  └── Containers destroyed after tests
       ↓
Stage 3: Build & Push
  ├── Build Docker image (multi-stage)
  ├── Tag with version (latest, sha, branch)
  └── Push to AWS ECR
       ↓
Stage 4: Deploy to EC2 (manual trigger available)
  ├── SSH into EC2
  ├── Login to ECR
  ├── Pull latest Docker image
  ├── Stop old container
  └── Start new container with environment variables
       ↓
Stage 5: Health Check
  └── Verify /status endpoint
      ├── PostgreSQL (RDS) ✅
      └── Neo4j (Aura) ✅
       ↓
Deployment marked successful ✅
```

**Automatic**: Stages 1-3 run on every push to main
**Manual**: Stage 4 deployment triggered via workflow_dispatch for controlled releases
       ↓
Stage 4: Deploy
  └── SSH into EC2, pull new image, restart container
       ↓
Stage 5: Smoke Test
  └── Hit /health endpoint on EC2
      Terminus confirms:
        ├── PostgreSQL (RDS) ✅
        └── Neo4j (Aura) ✅
       ↓
Deployment marked successful ✅
```

If any stage fails, the pipeline stops and the previous Docker container continues running on EC2. The live environment is never left in a broken state.

### Two-Stage Database Verification

The pipeline validates databases at two distinct stages:

**Stage 2 — Logic validation (throwaway containers on GitHub's servers):**
- Throwaway PostgreSQL and Neo4j Docker containers, identical to local test setup
- Validates that the application code and queries are correct
- Free, runs on GitHub's infrastructure, destroyed after every run
- Does not touch production databases

**Stage 5 — Connection validation (real cloud databases on EC2):**
- Smoke test hits the live `/health` endpoint after deployment
- NestJS Terminus health indicators actively ping RDS and Aura
- Validates that production credentials and network connectivity are working
- This is the only point in the pipeline where Aura and RDS are touched

### Health Check Implementation

The existing health check endpoint will be extended using `@nestjs/terminus` to report the status of both database connections:

```json
GET /health

{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {
    "postgres": { "status": "up" },
    "neo4j": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

GitHub Actions reads this response after deployment. If either database reports as down, the deployment is marked failed.

## Rationale

### Why GitHub Actions?

- **Free** for public repositories and generous free tier for private repos
- **Native GitHub integration** — no third-party service needed
- **Service containers** — can spin up Docker databases for E2E tests natively
- **SSH deployment** — can deploy to EC2 directly via SSH action
- **Industry standard** — relevant experience for career development

### Why Not Deploy Manually?

Manual SSH deployment was considered and rejected:
- Error-prone — easy to forget steps or deploy wrong branch
- Not reproducible across machines — laptop vs desktop inconsistency
- No automatic test gate — could deploy broken code
- Does not scale — every future change requires manual intervention
- Weaker thesis narrative — automation demonstrates mature engineering practice

### Why Throwaway Containers for E2E Tests?

Running E2E tests against Aura directly during CI was considered and rejected:
- Would require Aura credentials stored in GitHub secrets for every test run
- Risk of polluting production data during test runs
- Aura free tier has rate limits that could be hit by frequent CI runs
- Throwaway containers are faster, free, and completely isolated

### Why Develop Locally Against Docker?

Developing directly against cloud databases (Aura + RDS) was considered:
- Appealing for multi-machine consistency
- Rejected because mid-feature development risks pushing bad data or schema changes to production databases
- Local Docker provides fast feedback, safe to break things, no cost implications
- Cloud databases are only touched by the deployed backend, never directly by local development

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Never manually deploy again** — every push to main triggers the full pipeline
- **Tests are a hard gate** — broken code cannot reach EC2
- **Multi-machine friendly** — laptop or desktop, workflow is identical
- **Live environmeStatus

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Stage Docker Build

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder - Compile TypeScript
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production - Minimal runtime
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
USER nestjs  # Non-root for security
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
```

Benefits:
- Smaller images (~150MB vs ~500MB)
- Faster deployments
- No dev dependencies in production
- Enhanced security with non-root user

### AWS ECR Integration

Images are tagged with multiple identifiers:
```
<account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/injury-surveillance-backend:latest
<account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/injury-surveillance-backend:main-abc1234
<account>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/injury-surveillance-backend:main
```

This enables:
- `latest`: Always points to most recent main build
- `<branch>-<sha>`: Specific commit for rollback
- `<branch>`: Latest on that branch

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Triggers**:
- `push` to main/develop: Run tests + build + push to ECR
- `pull_request`: Run tests only
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual deployment to EC2

**Service Containers**:
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    env:
      POSTGRES_DB: identity_service
      POSTGRES_USER: identity_admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test-password
    
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:5.25-community
    env:
      NEO4J_AUTH: neo4j/test-password
```

**Build Optimization**:
- GitHub Actions cache for Docker layers
- Buildx for multi-platform support
- Metadata action for automated tagging

---

## Implementation nt always stable** — failed deployments don't break production
- **Full SDLC demonstrated** — code → test → build → deploy → verify, documented for thesis
- **Free** — GitHub Actions free tier is sufficient for this project scale

### Negative

- **Pipeline setup time** — initial configuration of GitHub Actions workflow takes time
- **SSH key management** — EC2 SSH credentials must be stored as GitHub secrets securely
- **Deployment latency** — a `git push` takes 2–5 minutes to reach EC2, not instant
- **GitHub dependency** — pipeline relies on GitHub Actions availability

### Mitigation

- **Pipeline setup** — documented step by step, done once
- **SSH key management** — GitHub encrypted secrets are the industry standard approach, appropriate for this use case
- **Deployment latency** — acceptable for this project scale; local Docker provides instant feedback during development
- **GitHub dependency** — GitHub Actions has high availability; acceptable risk for FYP scope

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Health Check Extension
1. Install `@nestjs/terminus` 
2. Extend existing health check endpoint with PostgreSQL and Neo4j indicators
3. Verify response format locally

### Phase 2 — GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Configure unit test stage
3. Configure E2E test stage with PostgreSQL and Neo4j service containers
4. Configure Docker build stage
5. Configure SSH deploy stage to EC2
6. Configure smoke test stage hitting `/health`

### Phase 3 — GitHub Secrets
Store the following as encrypted GitHub repository secrets:
- `EC2_HOST` — EC2 public IP or domain
- `EC2_SSH_KEY` — private SSH key for EC2 access
- `EC2_USER` — EC2 username (typically `ec2-user`)

### Phase 4 — Validation
1. Push a test change to main
2. Observe pipeline stages in GitHub Actions UI
3. Confirm smoke test passes
4. Confirm change is live on EC2
