# Enhanced Coach Injury Reporting Feature

## Overview
The injury reporting system has been enhanced to provide coaches with a streamlined workflow for reporting injuries, including both quick pitch-side reports and detailed medical reports.

## Backend Compatibility

No backend changes required! The system uses existing endpoints:
- `GET /teams/coach/my-teams` - Fetch coach's teams
- `GET /teams/:teamId/players` - Fetch team roster
- `POST /injuries` - Create injury report

Both quick and detailed reports use the same creation endpoint. Quick reports simply omit optional fields.
